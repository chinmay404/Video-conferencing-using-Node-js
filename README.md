# Video-conferencing-using-Node-js

This project is a web application built with Node.js and WebRTC that allows users to have video conferences with each other. The application uses the PeerJS library to establish peer-to-peer connections between users, and the Simple-Peer library to handle WebRTC signaling.

To use this application, simply navigate to the URL where the application is hosted in your web browser. You will be prompted to enter a room name, and once you enter the room name, you will be connected to the video conference.

The application allows users to turn their video and audio on and off, as well as to chat with other users in the conference. Users can also share their screen with the other users in the conference.

The application is built with a Node.js server that handles WebSockets connections and serves the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the client. The server also handles signaling messages between clients.

To run the application locally, you will need to install Node.js and the required dependencies by running "npm install" in the project directory. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server by running "npm start". The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

If you have any questions or issues with this project, please feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository. Thank you for using the Video Conferencing using Node.js!
